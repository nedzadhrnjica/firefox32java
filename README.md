# Firefox 32bit with Java plugin installer

This installer will prepare 32bit firefox with Java Plugin.

## About

Since Firefox, and other browser decided to disable NPAPI plugin support, there is a problem running Java applications on new/updated systems.

This installer will install Firefox 32bit with Java Plugin in subfolder, and allow you to run it from there.

## How

1. Download 'install.sh', and start it.
2. It will download two files in the same folder, and create a subdirectory named 'firefox/'.
3. After install, you will be able to start 32bit firefox using 'firefox/start.sh'.

## Additional details

Installer is automatic, except that you need manually to download Java version (link will be provided on screen, and web page for download will be opened).
